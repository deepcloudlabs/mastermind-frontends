## Frontend implementations of mastermind game using react, angular, vue, knockout, js, jquery etc.

Mastermind is a simple number guessing game. Computer picks a 3-digit random number where all digits are distinct. This number is a secret and a player tries to find the secret by guessing. Computer guides the player with a hint message summarizing how much the guess is close the secret. Assume that the secret number is 549 and player's first move is 123. Computer evaluates the input 123 and produces "No Match!" message, hence there is no digit matched! Player's next move is 456. Computer again evaluates the input 456 and produces the message "-2": The digits 4 and 5 are all matched but at the very wrong places! Player's next move is 567. Computer again evaluates the input 567 and produces the message "+1": Only one digit is matched at the correct place! Player's next move is 584. Computer again evaluates the input 584 and produces the message "+1-1": The digit 5 is matched at the correct place and the digit 4 is matched at the wrong place.  Player's next move is 540. Computer again evaluates the input 540 and produces the message "+2": The digits 5 and 4 are all matched at the correct places! Finally the player inputs 549 and wins the game!
